## how to use

On loading, the user will redirect to home page, and he can see the list of added repositories if there any, and an option
to delete the particular repository. On the right top there is a link to the search page. From the search page the user can 
search for repositories by selecting one of the check box. On a successful search the user can view the repository name 
and details in the form of a card and a button to add particular repository to collection.
